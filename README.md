## Definition: 
Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language, which allows you to create flexible, modular programs and reuse code. It is also platform-independent which allows the capability of moving the program easily from one computer to another.

## Goal: 
Teach the participants the basics of Java.

## Get Started:
1. Open jGrasp on the computer
2. Open a new Java file
3. Explain where to find things and the icons on the top of the file.
  * Ex. Compile, Run, Where to save, How to get line numbers, etc.

## Basics:
* Learn how to set up a java program
  * The main components (class, methods, etc.)
* Learn how to print (Strings)
* Learn about Variables (the different datatypes and how to use them)
* Learn about inputting and outputting data
* Learning about syntax (semicolons and brackets)
* Conditionals (ex. if statements)

## Challenges:
* Printing their name into the output box
* Creating a program that collects user input through the input box
* Programming a Trivia Game (using conditionals if the answer is right or wrong)

## Downloading:
* jGrasp is downloaded on the school computers.
